    <h1>Cloud Hosting</h1>
    <p>Multiple physical machines that act as one system. The system is abstracted into <br>
    multiple cloud services</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flexible</li>
        <li>Scalable</li>
        <li>Secure</li>
        <li>Cost-Effective</li>
        <li>High Configurability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Orcle calls their service provider <HL_Y>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or Oracle Cloud or OCI</HL_Y></p>

    <h2>Advantages of cloud Computing</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You pay only for what you consume, no up front cost</li>
        <li>Launch workloads anywhere in the world</li>
        <li>Thousands of customers sharing the cost</li>
        <li>Detailed monitoring, Easy to launch and experiment</li>
        <li>Resources are elastic, grow and shrink based on demand</li>
        <li>With a few clicks and a few minutes entire infrastructure, launched in minutes instead of weeks or months</li>
    </ul>

                    <li>Examples of this would be Google App Engine whre the developer can just deploy <br>
